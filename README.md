# RGB-colour-guessing-game

An app built using CSS and Vanilla JS. I built something similar when doing an online course a little while back and I decided to recreate it using more modern syntax.

Included in the JS is string literals, ternary operators, arrow functions, forEach loops and click event handlers.

Different difficulty modes set up by adding click listeners on mode buttons, looping through and assigning either three of six coloured circles, ensuring one of these is the matched colour to pick.
